            <h1>The Sun</h1>

            <p class="intro">
                The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, 
                radiating the energy mainly as visible light and infrared radiation. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth
            </p>
            <p>In its core the Sun currently fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second, 
                converting 4 million tons of matter into energy every second as a result. This energy, which can take between 10,000 and
                 170,000 years to escape the core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat.</p>

            <p>The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times. The Sun has been regarded by some cultures as a deity. The synodic rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the basis of solar calendars,
                 one of which is the Gregorian calendar, the predominant calendar in use today.</p>
