            <h1>Mercury</h1>

            <p class="intro">
                Mercury is a chemical element with the symbol Hg and atomic number 80. 
                It is commonly known as quicksilver and was formerly named hydrargyrum . A heavy, silvery d-block element, mercury is the only metallic element that is liquid at standard conditions for temperature and pressure; the only other element that is liquid under these conditions is the halogen bromine, 
                though metals such as caesium, gallium, and rubidium melt just above room temperature.
            </p>
            <p>Mercury is used in thermometers, barometers, manometers, sphygmomanometers, float valves, mercury switches, mercury relays, fluorescent lamps and other devices, though concerns about the element's toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favor of alternatives such as alcohol- 
                or galinstan-filled glass thermometers and thermistor- or infrared-based electronic instruments. 
                Likewise, mechanical pressure gauges and electronic strain gauge sensors have replaced mercury sphygmomanometers.</p>

            <p>Mercury dissolves many metals such as gold and silver to form amalgams. 
                Iron is an exception, and iron flasks have traditionally been used to trade mercury. 
                Several other first row transition metals with the exception of manganese, copper and zinc are also resistant in forming amalgams. Other elements that do not readily form amalgams with mercury include platinum.[12][13] Sodium amalgam is a common reducing agent in organic synthesis, and is also used in high-pressure sodium lamps.</p>
